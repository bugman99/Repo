	This week I tried learning the programs Blender, and unity.  I was unable to really get far in either as time was very short.  In blender,
I learned about the user interface and controls as well as adding objects.  Then I learned about the tools for manipulating onjects, such as scale,
translate, rotate, and mirror.  I could scale in a specific dimension by pressing "s" with "x", "y", or "z" and could apply a mirror for assisting 
symetrical designsI did make a few basic models and then learn to save the file as an image.  The most recent thing I learned for blender was the 
edit mode to directly manipulate vertices, edges, and faces as well as the extendfunction to protrude from a face.  I didn't get much in the ways 
of unity, but I did gain an understanding of the UI.  I saw the coding necessary for moving on bject with vector values.

	This weak I made a basic Unity project for the purpose of testing code involving movement.  In here I utilized the Input.GetKey to detect
user input first.  Then by using the translate method, specific to Unity for moving objects, changes object position with account to direction, 
speed, and time.  To use translate syntax properly: transform.Translate(Vector3./*direction goes here*/ * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);  The deltaTime
function is used specifically to maintain a constant rate, as the update function is based upon frames. Then the LookAt method is implemented to gear
the camera to constantly focus upon the object controled by the player.  LookAt was a little more simple as all that was needed was: 
transform.LookAt(/*target object*/);
